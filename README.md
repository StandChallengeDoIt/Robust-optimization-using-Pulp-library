# Robust-optimization-using-Pulp-librairie
The project aims to solve the portfolio problem using Pulp librairie. 
The profit return is considered as uncertain.
The robust counterpart along with the tractable robust model are developped considering cardinality uncertain set.
The model is linearised using dual problem for inner maximazation.
The code contains the resolution and simulation of the linearised problem,
